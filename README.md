## Description

This project serves as a playground to explore the Haystack framework. Haystack is an open-source Python framework that provides a modular and scalable approach to building end-to-end question answering (QA) systems. This repository contains sample code and configurations to help you get started with Haystack.

## Features

- Sample code to index and retrieve documents using Haystack
- Pre-built QA models for question answering tasks
- Configurations for different retrieval and reader models
- Example pipelines for end-to-end QA workflows

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/haystack-playground.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd haystack-playground`
3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended): `python3 -m venv env`
4. Activate the virtual environment: `source env/bin/activate`
